# Flight-Booking-System-in-Java-using-Switch-Case
As part of my 2nd year Advanced Programming Practice course, I had to create a simple project using Java to demonstrate its concepts, and I chose to create a simple Flight Booking System using Switch Case. In this repository I have put the report I prepared with my teammates and a PPT for the same.

1) Title: **FLIGHT BOOKING SYSTEM IN JAVA USING SWITCH-CASE**

2) Description

This project uses the simple concept of switch-case, iterative and conditional statements to create a rudimentary, yet easy to use and straightforward interface to book a flight and do the necessary steps in booking a flight ticket.

3) How to Install and Run this Program?
  
Simply download the file, and run it in a terminal or a compiler which supports Java and has the necessary prerequisites like JDK and Java C. In our case, we used Visual Studio Code running on Windows 11 with the latest version of Oracle's Java SE 21. We also tested this on some online compilers like onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler and Programiz.

4) How to Use and Feed your Inputs in the Code?

When you run the file, the terminal will display a simple text menu with different choices and will ask the user to enter their choice. Once a user decides what to choose, they must enter the code of their choice as displayed in the menu. After following the steps respective of their choice, they will brought back to the menu, where they can once again pick a choice. The process will repeat until the user decides to exit.

5) Credits

I developed this along with my teammate PREM LOHIA, my friends and colleagues at SRM IST Chennai.
